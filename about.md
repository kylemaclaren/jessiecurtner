### "They came to sit & dangle their feet off the edge of the world & after awhile they forgot everything but the good & true things they would do someday." ― Brian Andreas

#### My Story

Five years ago, on my birthday, I found myself at 7am in the morning crying on a yoga mat in a public workout class. My grief was so complete that I could barely conjure up the strength to respond to the teacher, “yes, I’m ok” and leave.

It took me until my 28th year to mourn the abuse I had been inflicting on myself since adolescence. And what better place to cry about self-induced pain than a boot-camp workout class? Somewhere in between kettle bell lunges it violently occured to me that there was no where I’d like to be less. And, I’d woken up painfully early on my birthday to get there.

I fell apart surrounded by strength trainers. It was the perfect analogy for my life. On the outside, I seemed to have it all together: a great job, a series of loving boyfriends, an attractive appearance and a confident demeanor. But on the inside, I felt hollow and increasingly anxious.

Slowly my inside began to dominate my outside experience with choices that aided to my self destruction. I entered into a toxic relationship, and I began making serious mistakes at work. To feel more in control, I worked out relentlessly and monitored what I ate obsessively.

It wasn’t until that day on the mat that I clearly formed the thought, “I don’t know or like myself at all” I had finally hit bottom - it was a huge relief.

I’m grateful for the tears of reclamation I spilt in that masochistic class. Because in that moment I woke up to my life for the first time in years. I became fully present to my sad inner world, and I held it in my heart like a weight heavier than anything you could squat with.

There is immense power in truth, and a few weeks later when the life coach, I had sought out with desperation, said to me, “maybe you’re just terribly insecure,” I felt my greatest fear, and my greatest hope for redemption, descend on me like a crumbling castle.

The pressure buried me for a moment in complete hopelessness, and I was sure I’d never take another breath. But I did. I exhaled with the knowing that I had survived what I feared most - someone really seeing what I knew to be true. “Terribly insecure” he said. Yes, I was.

With my truth no longer lurking in the darkest corner of my psyche, my healing was able to begin. The hardest part of being human is that only our darkest shadows really have the power to heal our soul.

A year and a few months later, I sat across from my truth-wielding coach again. I’d been boot-camp class clean for months and now practiced in a gentle yoga class. I’d also ended my unhealthy relationship and entered into a new one with myself.

After 15 years of back-to-back relationships I took a year off dating, and found myself to be a most interesting and surprising date. Journaling proved to be our best source of communication and in one entry I learned that I loved pie. I was literally shocked. I hadn’t eaten pie in years.

To commence my year of being single, I threw myself a “single's shower.” Pictures of old boyfriends and love notes from high school were displayed in the middle of a table surrounded by martini glasses and giggling girlfriends.

So back to that day, in the coach's office. I was no longer a terribly insecure girl. I was a a young woman getting to know herself with love, curiosity and an openness to new experiences that I’d never known before.

And I had an announcement to make: I’d met someone, I was in love and we were planning to quit our jobs and travel around the world together. Which we did. Just 6 months into our relationship, we left everything we understood to be home, to find refuge in ourselves and in one another (we’re still together and getting married in September).

Venturing into the unknown that year, both internally and externally, is what I am most proud of having done in my life. That journey proved to be the beginning of my vocation. A call to work with women who want to know and love themselves better.

I do the work I do, because I really believe the world needs more women who aren’t afraid to live their own lives freely and fiercely.

When we came back home, after a year abroad, I entered into a coaching certification program and I took up the life-long task of crafting the life and work of my dreams.

Today I can unabashedly say, I love who I am and who I’ve been. I wouldn’t change a single thing about the path that brought me to now. It has gifted me the capacity to sit with other women in their darkest hour and support them as they step into the light. I know from my own experience people can not only change, they can soar.

My spiritual practices such as yoga, mediation and writing are the foundation of my personal self care, but it’s no longer just about me. It’s about passing the torch to other women so that together we can begin to serve all that is good and true within ourselves and within our world.
